# My-Notes-on-Applied-ML

Here, I am sharing the notes I am developing of my Machine Learning lecture at Universiteit Gent, taken in 2022.

The reader will also find the notes I developed during the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) -- respecting Coursera's Code Sharing Policy. Images and screenshots come from the courses unless otherwise specified. This course was taken in 2020.
