    "Evaluation is a key part in applied machine learning. Once a model is trained, the evaluation step provides critical feedback on the trained model's performance characteristics, particularly those that might be important for your application. The results of the evaluation step  might help you understand which data instances are being classified or predicted incorrectly, which might in turn suggest better features or different kernel function or\n",
    "other refinements to your learning model in the feature and model refinement phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial search applications typically use a scorecard\n",
    "of multiple evaluation metrics to make important business decisions.\n",
    "Or development decisions about what models are chosen for use. So it's very important to choose evaluation\n",
    "methods that match the goal of your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EVALUATION** is important since different applications have different goals. Moreover, despite that accuracy is widely used to evaluate a model, there are much more options worth studying. For example, in the health application, where a classifier is used to detect tumors in a medical\n",
    "image, we may want the classifier to error on the side of caution.\n",
    "And flag anything that even has a small chance of being cancerous.\n",
    "Even if it means sometimes incorrectly classifying healthy tissue as diseased.\n",
    "In this case, the classifier evaluation method\n",

    "false positives are those white points in the positive prediction region.\n",
    "Likewise, true negatives are the white points in\n",
    "the negative prediction region and\n",
    "false negatives are black points in the negative prediction region. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen one metric that can be derived from\n",
    "the confusion matrix counts namely **accuracy**. But, let's look at some other evaluation metrics we can compute from these four numbers. A very simple related number that's sometimes used is **classification error**,\n",
    "which is the sum of the counts off the diagonal\n",
    "namely all of the errors divided by total instance count,\n",
    "and numerically, this **is equivalent to just one minus the accuracy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall**, also known as the **true positive rate**,\n",
    "**sensitivity** or **probability of detection** is such an evaluation metric and it's obtained\n",

    "Now suppose that we have a machine learning task,\n",
    "where it's really important to avoid false positives.\n",
    "In other words, we're fine with cases where not all true positive instances\n",
    "are detected but when the classifier does predict the positive class,\n",
    "we want to be very confident that it's correct (a lot of customer facing prediction problems are like this).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** is an evaluation metric that reflects the situation\n",

    "true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives**:\n",

    "predicts that a negative instance is in the positive class. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "derived from this classification scenario. We can see that a precision of 0.68 means that about 68 percent of the points in\n",
    "the positive prediction region to the left of\n",
    "the decision boundary or 13 out of the 19 instances are correctly labeled as positive. A recall of 0.87 means,\n",
    "that of all true positive instances,\n",
    "so all black points in the figure,\n",
    "the positive prediction region has 'found about 87 percent of them' or 13 out of 15. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted a classifier that was oriented towards higher levels of\n",
    "precision like in the search engine query suggestion task, we might want a decision boundary instead that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"different_errors_eg1.png\" width=700 high = 600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, all the points in\n",
    "the positive prediction region seven out of seven are true positives,\n",
    "giving us a perfect precision of 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this comes at a cost because out of\n",
    "the 15 total positive instances eight of them are now false negatives,\n",
    "in other words, they're incorrectly predicted as being negative.\n",
    "And so, recall drops to 7 divided by 15 or 0.47. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we would want to minimize false negatives and obtain a high recall (for instance, for tumor detection), the model would look more like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"different_errors_eg2.png\" width=700 high = 600>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this also comes with a cost since the number of false positives,\n",
    "things that the detector triggers as\n",
    "possible tumors that are actually not, has gone up.\n",
    "So, recall is a perfect 1.0 score but the precision has dropped to 15 out of 42 or 0.36.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate a classic trade-off\n",
    "that often appears in machine learning applications.\n",

    "    - Learning curve: how much does accuracy (or other metric) change as a function of the amount of training data? These are useful as part of a cost-benefit analysis. Gathering training data in the form of labeled examples is often time-consuming and expensive. So being able to estimate the likely performance improvement of your classifier, if you say invest in doubling the amount of training data, can be a useful analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Sensitivity analysis: how much does accuracy (or other metric) change as a function of key learning parameter values? This may be important to perform especially if there are other costs such as runtime efficiency that are critical variables when deploying an operational system, that are correlated with different values of parameter. For example, decision tree depth or future value threshold. In this way, a more complete picture of the trade-offs achievable across different performance dimensions can help you make the best practical deployment decisions for your machine learning model. "
